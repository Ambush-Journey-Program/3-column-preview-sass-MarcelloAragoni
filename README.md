## Brief

Your challenge is to build out the previously built 3-column preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible, but this time using SASS.

**Your users should be able to:**

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## Running the project 

### Using `yarn`:
1. Run `yarn` to install the project dependecies.
2. Run `yarn start` to start the project (this will also compile and watch SASS changes). 

### Using `npm`:
1. Run `npm install` to install the project dependecies.
2. Run `npm start` to start the project (this will also compile and watch SASS changes).
